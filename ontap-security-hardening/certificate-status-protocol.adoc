Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) enables ONTAP applications that use TLS communications, such as LDAP or TLS, to receive digital certificate status when OCSP is enabled. The application receives a signed response signifying that the certificate requested is good, revoked, or unknown.

OCSP enables determination of the current status of a digital certificate without requiring certificate revocation lists (CRLs).

By default, OCSP certificate status checking is disabled. It can be turned on with the command `security config ocsp enable -app name`, where the app name can be `autosupport`, `audit_log`, `fabricpool`, `ems`, `kmip`, `ldap_ad`, `ldap_nis_namemap`, or `all`. The command requires advanced privilege level.
