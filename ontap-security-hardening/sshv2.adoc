[.lead]
The `security ssh modify` command replaces the existing configurations of the SSH key exchange algorithms, ciphers, or MAC algorithms for the cluster or an SVM with the configuration settings you specify.

[TIP]
====
NetApp recommends the following:

* Use passwords for user sessions.
* Use a public key for machine access.

* hmac-sha2-512
* hmac-sha1-etm
* hmac-sha1-96-etm
* hmac-sha2-256-etm
* hmac-sha2-512-etm
* hmac-md5-etm
* hmac-md5-96-etm
* hmac-ripemd160-etm
* umac-64-etm
