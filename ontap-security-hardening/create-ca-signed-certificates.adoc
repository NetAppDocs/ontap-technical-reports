For many organizations, the self-signed digital certificate for ONTAP web access is not compliant with their InfoSec policies. On production systems, it is a NetApp best practice to install a CA-signed digital certificate for use in authenticating the cluster or SVM as an SSL server. 

You can use the `security certificate generate-csr` command to generate a certificate signing request (CSR), and the `security certificate install` command to install the certificate you receive back from the CA.

.Steps

. To create a digital certificate that is signed by the organization's CA, do the following:

.. Generate a CSR.

.. Follow your organization's procedure to request a digital certificate using the CSR from your organization's CA. For example, using Microsoft Active Directory Certificate Services web interface, go to `<CA_server_name>/certsrv` and request a certificate.

.. Install the digital certificate in ONTAP.
