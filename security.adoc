== Zero Trust
// March 2023 - 9.12.1 - Dan Tulledge
*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19756-tr-4829.pdf[TR-4829: NetApp and Zero Trust^]* - Zero Trust traditionally has been a network-centric approach of architecting micro core and perimeter (MCAP) to protect data, services, applications, or assets with controls known as a segmentation gateway. NetApp ONTAP takes a data-centric approach to Zero Trust in which the storage management system becomes the segmentation gateway to protect and monitor access of our customer’s data. In particular, the FPolicy Zero Trust engine and the FPolicy partner ecosystem becomes a control center to gain a detailed understanding of normal and aberrant data access patterns and identify insider threats.
