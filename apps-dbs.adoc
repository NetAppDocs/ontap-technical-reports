ONTAP is the foundation for data management and data protection for many enterprise application and database technologies. The following pages provide guidance on the best practices and implementation procedures.

== Microsoft SQL Server
*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/8585-tr4590.pdf[TR-4590: Best practice guide for Microsoft SQL Server with ONTAP^]* - This best practice guide enables storage administrators and database administrators to successfully deploy Microsoft SQL Server on NetApp storage.

*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/12400-tr4714.pdf[TR-4714: Best practices for Microsoft SQL Server using NetApp SnapCenter^]* - This best practice guide is intended for storage and application administrators so that they can successfully deploy Microsoft SQL Server on NetApp storage using NetApp SnapCenter technology for data protection.

== Oracle
*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/8744-tr3633pdf.pdf[TR-3633: Oracle databases on ONTAP^]* - This document covers the recommended practices guide that enable storage administrators and database administrators to successfully deploy Oracle on NetApp ONTAP storage.

*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/85630-tr-4969.pdf[TR-4969: Oracle Database Performance on NetApp AFF A-Series and C-Series^]* - NetApp ONTAP is a powerful data-management platform with native capabilities that include inline compression, nondisruptive hardware upgrades, and the ability to import a LUN from a foreign storage array. Up to 24 nodes can be clustered together, simultaneously serving data through Network File System (NFS), Server Message Block (SMB), iSCSI, Fibre Channel (FC), and Nonvolatile Memory Express (NVMe) protocols. In addition, NetApp Snapshot technology is the basis for creating tens of thousands of online backups and fully operational database clones. In addition to the rich feature set of ONTAP, there are a wide variety of user requirements, including database size, performance requirements, and data protection needs. The focus of this document is bare metal database performance using NetApp AFF storage systems, including both the A-Series and C-Series, and it covers both maximums and the practical difference between the two AFF options.

*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/85629-tr-4971.pdf[TR-4971: Virtualized Oracle database performance on NetApp AFF A-Series and C-Series^]* - NetApp ONTAP is a powerful data-management platform with native capabilities that include inline compression, nondisruptive hardware upgrades, and the ability to import a LUN from a foreign storage array.

*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19666-tr-4591.pdf[TR-4591: Oracle data protection: Backup, recovery, replication, and disaster recovery^]* - This document covers the recommended practices guide that enable storage administrators and database administrators to successfully backup, recover, replicate and provide disaster recovery to Oracle on NetApp ONTAP storage.

*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/8583-tr4592.pdf[TR-4592: Oracle on MetroCluster^]* - This document describes best practices, test procedures, and other considerations for operating Oracle databases on a NetApp MetroCluster synchronous replication feature. 

*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19750-tr-4534.pdf[TR-4534: Migration of Oracle Databases to NetApp Storage Systems^]* - This document explains the overall considerations for planning a migration strategy, outlines the three different levels in which data movement takes place, and details some of the various procedures available.

*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/9138-tr4695.pdf[TR-4695: Database storage tiering with NetApp FabricPool^]* - This document describes the benefits and configuration options of NetApp FabricPool with various databases, including the Oracle relational database management system (RDBMS).

*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/40384-tr-4899.pdf[TR-4899: Oracle database transparent application failover with NetApp SnapMirror business continuity^]* - NetApp SnapMirror Business Continuity (SM-BC) and Oracle Real Application Cluster (RAC)
can provide transparent application failover (TAF) and continuity in the face of site outages and true disasters. This paper describes the use of a NetApp AFF storage array with SM-BC as the storage component of RAC, and provides configuration guidance and best practices. 

*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/21901-tr-4876.pdf[TR-4876:Oracle Multitenancy with ONTAP solution and deployment best practices^]* - This technical report provides high-level solution best practices on how to provision, manage, and protect Oracle Multitenant databases by using NetApp ONTAP storage to maximize the benefits of both Oracle Multitenant databases and the features of ONTAP software

== PostgreSQL
*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/17140-tr4770.pdf[TR-4770: PostgreSQL database on ONTAP^]* - PostgreSQL comes with variants that include PostgreSQL, PostgreSQL Plus, and EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS). PostgreSQL is typically deployed as the back-end database for multi-tier applications. It is supported by common middleware packages (such as PHP, Java, Python, Tcl/Tk, ODBC, and JDBC) and has historically been a popular choice for open-source database management systems. This document covers the configuration requirements and guidance on tuning and storage configuration for deploying PostgreSQL on NetApp ONTAP data management software.
