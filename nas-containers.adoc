== FlexCache
*link:https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/7336-tr4743pdf.pdf[TR-4743: FlexCache in ONTAP^]* - NetApp® FlexCache® is a caching technology that creates sparse, writable replicas of volumes on the same or different NetApp ONTAP® clusters. It can bring data and files closer to the user for faster throughput with a smaller footprint. This document provides a deeper explanation of how FlexCache technology works and provides best practices, limits, recommendations, and considerations for design and implementation.
